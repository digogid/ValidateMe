# ValidateMe
C# Domain validation

ValidateMe is a domain validation lib. You can use it just to validate some variables or model's properties or you can even receive some user friendly error messages as well.

It was built as an extension lib to types like int, short, long, DateTime, string, TimeSpan, double and float.

It is simple to use. You ask ValidateMe to ensure that your property or variable is something you want it to be.

Besides domain validation. You can simply use ValidateMe to check some variables values. As said before, ValidateMe is just an extension library. All methods returns bool values telling whether the validation has failed or not. So, if you want to check if some variable pass some kind of validation, you can use it in a simple if or ternary.

Just to finish, you can add ValidateMe on your application by downloading it from nuget.org.

Please feel free to send messages to make the library better. Any help will be appreciated.

Go to wiki page to learn more about how to use it.
